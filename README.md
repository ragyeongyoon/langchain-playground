# langchain-playground

A practical playground for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based QA systems using LangChain, FAISS, HuggingFace, and OpenAI.

This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebook implementations created as part of the **Korea University Summer SWÂ·AI Camp 2025**, focusing on large language model applications and prompt engineering.
